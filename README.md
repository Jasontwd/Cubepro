# Supercharged 3D Systems Cube Pro Trio
## Totally rebuilt into a high temperature production printer

Having access to the high quality 3DXTech filaments meant that I could take an old Cube Pro Trio and turn it into a fast high-temperature production printer.  This means I can now use various types of filaments including water soluble supports. Including High Temp filaments up to 420deg C

This has taken my 3D printing to another level, and means there is less waste and less issues.  When it comes to filaments, you get what you pay for - so when quality matters, the 3DXTech filaments are fantastic.

## <b>History on this build</b>

These days there are lots of old 2nd hand printers out there in the market that sometimes need a new lease on life.

3D Systems produced their desktop Cube Pro Duo and trio several years ago and sent them off into mass manufacture.

They are out there for a good deal, if you are patient and can find one.  I found mine on Trade Me.  Also check out eBay and hit up your network.

Built like the proverbial 'brick shit house', these machines were slow but did a great job. The internal drive train, stepper motors, rails and enclosure are generally built very well, they form a solid basis of a good rebuild.

The professional looking enclosure is also well made, from Aluminum composite panel (ACP) with a LCD in built and glass door to top it all off.

Proprietary software and filament cases (with electronic chip) meant you where locked into their software and their filament.  In New Zealand it was hard to source filaments, which is frustrating and limits what you can do with the machine.

I found my printer on Trade Me in mid 2019, after a mate had also bought 2.
